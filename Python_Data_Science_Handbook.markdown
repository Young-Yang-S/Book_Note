# Python Data Science Handbook 
 
by **Jake VanderPlas**  (Follow the step of Jake and explore the DS field by Python)

## Module One: Preface 

*  Data science is an interdisciplinary subject

*  Three key distinct areas which together comprise data science: **Statistics, Computer Science and Domain expertise**.  A statistician who knows how to model and summarize
datasets; A computer scientist who can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize this data; and A domain expertiseâ€”necessary both to formulate the right questions and to put their answers in context.

*  Python packages Data scientist must know: **NumPy** for manipulation of homogeneous array-based data, **Pandas** for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, **SciPy** for common scientific computing tasks, **Matplotlib** for publication-quality visualizations, **IPython** for interactive execution and sharing of code, **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning.

## Mdule Two: Numpy Introduction

*  Image can be regarded as two-dimensional array of numbers representing pixel brightness across the area.

*  The first key thing for data scientist is to convert the information (Image, Text, Sound) we are focusing into arrays of data.

*  How to import Numpy module: Import numpy as np

*  **How to create Array**   
```
    np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='float32')
```
