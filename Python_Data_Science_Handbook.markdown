# Python Data Science Handbook 
 
by **Jake VanderPlas**  (Follow the step of Jake and explore the DS field by Python)

## Module One: Preface 
*  Data science is a interdisciplinary subject
*  Three key distinct areas which together comprise data science: **Statistics, Computer Science and Domain expertise**.  A statistician who knows how to model and summarize
datasets; A computer scientist who can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize this data; and A domain expertiseâ€”necessary both to formulate the right questions and to put their answers in context.
*  Python packages Data scientist must know: **NumPy** for manipulation of homogeneous array-based data, **Pandas** for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, **SciPy** for common scientific computing tasks, **Matplotlib** for publication-quality visualizations, **IPython** for interactive execution and sharing of code, **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning.
