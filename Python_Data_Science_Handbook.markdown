## Module One: Preface 
*  Data science is a interdisciplinary subject
*  Three key distinct areas which together comprise data science: **Statistics, Computer Science and Domain expertise**.  A statistician who knows how to model and summarize
datasets; A computer scientist who can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize this data; and A domain expertiseâ€”necessary both to formulate the right questions and to put their answers in context.
